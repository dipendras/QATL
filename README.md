# QATL
 Quadrotor Autonomous Tracking &amp; Landing (QATL) for  AscTec Pelican quadrotor on Husqvarna Automower 330X (mobile platform) with OptiTrack (motion capture system).

This repository represents the Flight Control Software Architecture designed and implemented by Razeen Hussain, Divya Shah and Dipendra Subedi; students of EMARO+ at the Universita degli studi di Genova. The detailed report of the work is added into the repository.

The system comprises of a quadrotor, AscTec Pelican; a mobile platform, Husqvarna Automower 330X; and a motion capture system, OptiTrack. Using the feedback from the motion capture and the control architecture as mentioned in the report the quadrotor is capable of autonomously tracking the mobile platform and eventually land on it, while inside the capture arena.
